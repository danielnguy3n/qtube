## Testing
QTube uses sensitive scopes from the Google and YouTube APIs (e.g. for accessing user data and managing YouTube content). It has not yet been submitted for OAuth verification, which means users cannot sign in with their own Google accounts at this stage.

For testing purposes, only whitelisted test accounts can authenticate and use the full functionality of the app. If you're reviewing or testing the project, please use the test credentials provided or contact the developer for access.
